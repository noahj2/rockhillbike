- Populate trails page with links to individual trails (Is this really a feature?  Isnt this what the detail modal is for.)
- Pull tip of month from database done on 1 page, 
- Slideshow in header should be populated from database not hardcoded (requires additional photos based on size, only one is available on entity)
- Images in slideshow take full seconds to load on high bandwidth connection
- Is wellness tip supposed to have an image?
- Default text (and spot for regular text) for trail of the month on homepage missing
- Is trail etiquite hardcoded?  If so put in the content, if not create functionality.
- Is the about page hardcoded?  If so there are errors in the text, if not create functionality.
- Donations list on get involved.. is it hardcoded? If not we need functionality...
- What about the sections on that page, is it hardcoded?
- The logo for the page overlaps the nav.  That causes you to accidently goto the home page fairly often. (Design decision by Chris he wanted it to overlap I agree though)
